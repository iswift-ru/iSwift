# Build a note-taking app with Flutter + Firebase â€” Part I
The practice of creating a simplified â€˜cloneâ€™ of Google Keep from scratch

Iâ€™m a fan of [Google Keep](https://www.google.com/keep/), Iâ€™ve been using it since it was launched. I put pending tasks, reminders for chores, almost anything needs to remember, into Keep. Itâ€™s intuitive to use, helps me stay focused on the priorities.
Since Iâ€™ve been building [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) apps during the past two years, I think it might be interesting to make a notebook app like Keep from scratch.

The so-called â€˜**Flutter Keep**â€™ app I made so far looks like:

[![Flutter Keep](https://iswift.ru/images/2020-03-09_22-11-25.png)](https://youtu.be/GXNXodzgbcM)

Iâ€™m going to introduce the process in a series of articles. Key components will be added to the app during iterations, to make it easier to understand.
In this first part of the series, weâ€™re going to set up the Flutter project, provide an authentication process, and a simple screen to show the note list.

Letâ€™s get started.

Before creating the project, you may want to enable web support via the command: ```flutter config -- enable-web```, if you want the app to be able to run on Web besides Android and iOS.
Now, execute the command: ```flutter create flt_keep``` to create the Flutter Keep app, ```flt_keep``` is the package name that will be used in the import statements.
For those who are new to Flutter, please follow the [Get started guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to install the SDK, and get familiar with the project structure.

## Data structure

For a notebook app, the first thing to consider is how the notes should be persisted and queried.
What I concern includes:
* First, the privacy. Notes of different accounts should be separated from each other.
* Second, the app ought to work offline. Users should be able to take notes under any network condition. It is the appâ€™s responsibility to sync the data when network connectivity recovers.
My choice is [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore), mainly because of the experience I gained from previous projects, but also because it is straightforward to adapt.

I decided to use a dedicated collection to store each userâ€™s notes, one document for a single note. For the reasons:
* Better segregation of each accountâ€™s data
* Easy to query
* Avoids some [limitations](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quotas#limits) in reading & writing data

This approach also comes with a cost, but it is acceptable for a demonstration purpose. That is, I have to create indexes for each collection dynamically, Iâ€™ll discuss the issue in a later article.

For now, the data structure is like:

## App architecture
Now itâ€™s time to consider how to organize the app logic. It wonâ€™t worth it to apply a â€˜realâ€™ architecture to an app mostly for demonstration. But thereâ€™s still a need to manage states across multiple screens in the app.
In this case, weâ€™re going to use the [provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) package to manage the app state. It allows us to write code in a reactive (or data-driven) style.
The most important screens in the app include:
* The authentication screen, watching the signed-in state, makes sure that only authenticated users can take notes
* The note list screen, displaying the most recent state of the notes, should react to changes to any note
* The note editor should also be reactive to outside modifications of the particular note being edited
Via providers, we can fulfill the above requirements easier, with a cleaner codebase.
With the scheme in mind, letâ€™s begin writing the code.
To use ```provider``` and the Firebase SDKs, we have to add the dependencies to the ```pubspec.yaml``` file:

```
provider: ^4.0.2
firebase_core: ^0.4.4
firebase_auth: ^0.15.4
cloud_firestore: ^0.13.3
google_sign_in: ^4.1.4
```
Please follow the [detailed instructions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup) to integrate Firebase SDKs for both Android and iOS, also the [Web platform](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup).

## Entry of the app
Remember that we have to reject unauthenticated users, letâ€™s build a gatekeeper widget to the root.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/xinthink/7d1ad8cc4421f50266d3406342430c10.js"></script>
main.dart

The ```StreamProvider/Consumer``` pair here is to watch the ```onAuthStateChanged```, a stream of Firebase authentication events, whenever the signed-in state has changed, the ```Consumer``` will get notified and re-build the widget according to the current state.
A little trick here is to use a ```CusttentUser``` to wrap the ```FirebaseUser```, to distinguish the default initial and the unauthenticated state, both of which are ```null```.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/xinthink/9d0853544425791c1aee55eb78900b72.js"></script>
current_user.dart

## Google Sign-in & Firebase Auth
I use Google Sign-in as an example because itâ€™s easy to integrate. In fact, it is just one of the many services supported by Firebase Auth. You can enable what you need in the Firebase console.
![Available authentication providers](https://iswift.ru/images/1_p28rWu_gssWRU4xwb5NTQg.png)
Available authentication providers

**The code snippet to authenticate using Google Sign-In:**

<script src="https://gist.github.com/xinthink/3c2e2a93b54871ba72a4235ccf2f0554.js"></script>
login_screen.dart

Just ask for a Google Sign-In credential, and then use it to authenticate with Firebase.
You can see that thereâ€™s nothing to do after the authentication finished successfully. In this situation, the ```FirebaseAuth.onAuthStateChanged``` stream emits a â€˜Signed-inâ€™ event, which triggers a re-build of the root gatekeeper widget so that the ```HomeScreen``` is rendered.
The above is an example of [Reactive Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming): just mutate the state, the listeners who concern about the state will do the remaining jobs.
Back to the project, before testing your login screen, please make sure youâ€™re not ignoring the following settings:
* For the Android platform, you must [specify the SHA-1 fingerprint](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/android/google-signin#before_you_begin) in the Firebase console
* For the iOS platform, you have to [add a custom URL scheme](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/ios/google-signin#2_implement_google_sign-in) to the Xcode project
* For the Web platform, add a meta tag like ```<meta name="google-signin-client_id" content="{web_client_id}">``` to ```web/index.html```, you can find the Web client id in the â€˜OAuth 2.0 Client IDsâ€™ section of your projectâ€™s [credentials page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) in the Google Cloud console

## Querying notes

With an authenticated user, we can now enter the main screen of the app, the note list.
But how can you add the first note without a note editor? You can do this with the Firebase Console:

![Firestore console](https://iswift.ru/images/1_JA5qv8JPFfjNA9zAQ3Nhcg.png)
Firestore console

Please name the collection as ```notes-{user_id}```, and you can find your user id in the *Authentication* page of the Firebase Console.
To reinforce privacy security, you may also want to set access rules against the dataset, making sure that users can only see & edit their own notes.

![Firestore data access rules](https://iswift.ru/images/1_8bNXjjHd9lQqAE-BKtPEsQ.png)
Firestore data access rules

Before we can retrieve notes from Firestore, we need a model that represents an individual note, and functions to transform between the Firestore model and our own.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/xinthink/209fa3e9e37de1d9ae098101c12e2e5d.js"></script>

Again weâ€™re going to use a ```StreamProvider``` in the ```HomeScreen```, which watches the notes query result, so that any changes happen to the backend reflect here instantly. The Firestore SDK also delivers the [offline capabilities](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/enable-offline) we need, we donâ€™t have to change the code used to access the data.
And thanks for the gatekeeper widget we built previously, which enables us to retrieve the authentication info any time via ```Provider.of<CurrentUser>.```

<script src="https://gist.github.com/xinthink/4e04f2a3ecb3b5097fe0912fca898337.js"></script>
home_screen.dart

The code is a little bit verbose, for I provide here a floating ```AppBar``` looks like the one in Google Keep.
For ```NotesGrid``` and ```NotesList```, they are much similar: just kind of a wrapper of a ```SliverGrid``` and a ```SliverList``` respectively.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/xinthink/e972c4944bf197e60c98e19125f395bc.js"></script>
notes_grid.dart

Iâ€™m not posting all the detailed code here. Please find the full example in my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/xinthink/flutter-keep).
If everything goes fine, you should now be able to see the first note in your self-made ***Flutter Keep*** app!

Weâ€™re doing well so far. Weâ€™ve built a simple reactive-styled app by using the ```provider``` package, and also learned how to use the Firebase toolkits.

However, the app is less than useful without a note editor. Weâ€™ll add more functionalities to it in the next parts of the series.

Thank you for reading! ðŸ™Œ
