# Widget Communication with Flutter using VoidCallback and Function(x)
> In this article we’re going to investigate how we can use callback-style events to communicate between widgets with Flutter.

Why is this important? It allows us to separate our widgets into small, testable units that can be adaptable to their context.

## *Creating a New Flutter Project*

As always, we’ll start off by setting up a new project:

```# New Flutter project
$ flutter create widget_communication

# Open this up inside of VS Code
$ cd widget_communication && code .```
