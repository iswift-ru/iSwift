I know your reaction would be like this

> Cloud Firestore is Firebase’s new flagship database for mobile app development. It improves on the successes of the Realtime Database with a new, more intuitive data model. Cloud Firestore also features richer, faster queries and scales better than the Realtime Database.

As we all know cloud firestore is firebase next-generation database how is it possible that the realtime database becomes better that cloud firestore. That’s why I’m here.

Let’s see some situations where realtime database becomes more resonable to use than firestore —

1. The first situation is when your app is like a realtime painting app or something, in which multiple users are updating the database and reading from the database simultaneously within every fraction of seconds. In firestore it can cost you a ton of money because firestore bill is directly propotional to the number of reads and writes.

2. The second one is that realtime database is a mature product and you can expect the stability, and it’s a tried-and-true product.

3. The third case, it is possible to use both of the databases together within the same Firebase app or project to reduce your firebase bill.

4. The first and third case is applied if you’re concerned about your firebase bill that’s because realtime database charges only for bandwidth and storage and not on each read and write.

I think you got the point now
